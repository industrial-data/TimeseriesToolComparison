# Monitoring

**Scope:** Monitoring (batch anomaly detection). Reporting functionalties (e.g. journals) to be reviewed in daily/weekly/monthly meetings

- **Batch visualization**
  - Visualize several batch trends per grade, lot, batchid, step
  - Filtering
  - Pattern recognition (optional)
  - Data export
- **User defined functions for batch (a.k.a. fingerprints)**
  - Max T, min T\_jack, median, mode, percentiles, interquartile-range
- **OEE charts (variability, dashboards)**
  - Box Plots, violin plot colored by datetime
- **Batch alignment**
  - Time-based (DTW)
  - Leading variable (optional)
- **Golden batch**
  - MDC (best reaction time)
  - Historical variability (overlay plot with changes time)
  - MDC vs now
  - Reactor I vs Reactor II
- **Batch anomaly detection and notification**
  - Statistical process control for batches
  - Alerts when batches are out of normalities
  - Real-time analysis capabilities (yes/no)
  - Transferring models using templates (AF)
- **Journal, reports, documentation**
  - Building reports that are updated daily/weekly/monthly
  - Editing, commenting, documenting actions and changes
